in the comments because you know boost the youtube algorithm because people are commenting on my video so you know what if you hate it feel free to comment too okay here goes attempting to contain my smile i was the eager kid watching my second grade teacher read my proudly written short story i heard her chuckle as she looked down at me sweetly and said jillian you can't use an exclamation mark after every sentence not everything in life is that exciting i was horrified my mind simply could not grasp the idea that life could be anything but positively thrilling although i have grown to understand the presence of both the silly and the serious i never lost that spark of unrivaled positivity growing up my natural enthusiasm became obvious to the people around me from volleyball teams to summer camps i have always received similar recognitions most positive sunshine and best friend awards with these affectionate reminders as a constant throughout my childhood i embraced my cheerful personality yet i knew i was much more than this my inability to feel content being known as just the happy kid was my motivation to seek out the things that bring out the in me i threw myself into new ventures from advocating for inclusion at my school and tutoring students in stem subjects to teaching myself piano and taking action in my community against social injustice as i dove into a variety of activities i realized my passion for improving my community and began leveraging my positive outlook as a tool to become a change maker among my peers it is with this action-oriented attitude that i listen for opportunities to improve and enrich the lives around me whether in my local community or elsewhere in the world seeing my phones blasted with headlines boasting environmental and social challenges shatters my heart yet those news stories motivated me to fight for what i believe is right in my sophomore year i learned about the devastating effects of plastic on wildlife leading me to write to texas senator ted cruz urging him to ban the use of plastic bags by local grocery stores just as california did the year before in a physics lab i was told by a male classmate to clean up a mess because it is a job for a woman which was shocking to hear it motivated me to encourage myself and other women to stand up for our rights in the annual women's march for equality for the right cause i am not afraid to spark progressive conversations among my peers from debating potential solutions to immigration policy to working with my principal to plan a school shooting drill [Music] while it is easy to become overwhelmed in the face of societal issues i always see the world not for what it is but for what it could be and i'm willing to help make it happen marching alongside my friends and hundreds of others in the filled me with pride knowing i contributed to a cause that will someday benefit millions of people with hundreds of signs flying overhead i held my freshly painted sign proudly it is within these moments that i champion my positive energy and confidence leading others to stand up during these impactful opportunities for change i now welcome my natural positivity as a gift to drive success in everything i do it is not just a characteristic it is my way of life my defining trait my identity however i learned that it is not just about being positive or receiving smile awards it is what i can achieve and how i can improve the lives of others even so i still appreciated receiving one last best smile award at my 11th grade choir banquet reminding me of the hopeful little kid still shining brightly within me as a kid i always thought i could change the world now i am positive i will so that was my essay all 647 words i know i see like a ton of these videos all the time and i definitely watched so many of them when i was going through the college application process it's honestly just so helpful to hear someone else's take on the common app essay and the fact that there's so many essays out there it just proves that like there's no one way to do it because my essay is definitely very different from a lot of essays that i've seen because most are like more story oriented mine was definitely more me like just talking about like who i am like to the core which was actually so hard to write because i did not like talking about my identity at first but i did feel that it was just like a really important part of me and i really wanted to share that with colleges because they didn't want me for who i am then you know what i don't want them either anyways i think one of the reasons that colleges liked this essay was the fact that it seemed very honest there was a lot of other things that i could have written about given that i'm literally going into tech and business and my essay is about literally nothing even close to that it's literally about like positivity and social justice i think the fact that i took a chance and wrote about something that number one is controversial and number two is just like literally a trait about me that i thought was like worthwhile about telling they must have really seen into my character and hopefully gotten to know me throughout this essay as they were reading it i think another thing is the fact that i put so many little stories in there um even going back to like the very first one when i was in second grade my teacher was talking to me um to like getting like all these like little like smile awards and stuff like when i was a kid and even trying out like all these new things and like not being satisfied with just being seen as that and then going into all this stuff about like social justice i think there were a lot of different facets of the essay that they could get to know like a lot of different sides of me in these just like 650 words so i think that's another huge thing is that i fit a lot of stuff into this essay yet it didn't feel brand at least hopefully it doesn't feel cramped i think that i fit a lot of stuff in there even though it was only about two things which was positivity and social justice but within that you got to know so many things about me that it felt like so much more and then i think the third thing that colleges may have liked about this essay was the fact that it showed that i kind of like cared outside of my little like personal bubble i've been editing like a ton of you guys essays and the one thing that i've noticed is that a lot of the essays are really personal which is like fantastic like you want your essay to be super personal super full of like your own emotions and feelings and details about your life but there always comes a certain turning point in every essay that you want to flip to this is a story about me to this is how i use this story to build myself up and this is how i became the person i am and this is why i am me and how i want to spread the positive things that i will bring to the world and the people around me and that sounds like super cliche but basically to sum up colleges just want to know that you care about the people around you and the world around you and that you are going to use your past experiences to help future causes wow that was really articulate okay cool that's exactly what i want to say so those are the main three reasons that i have of why i think this essay was just really impactful and why maybe colleges liked it and let me into their school definitely make sure to enter the giveaway or if you really need it edited right now then go
