in the comments because you know boost the youtube algorithm because people are commenting on my video so you know what if you hate it feel free to comment too okay here goes attempting to contain my smile i was the eager kid watching my second grade teacher read my proudly written short story i heard her chuckle as she looked down at me sweetly and said jillian you can't use an exclamation mark after every sentence not everything in life is that exciting i was horrified my mind simply could not grasp the idea that life could be anything but positively thrilling although i have grown to understand the presence of both the silly and the serious i never lost that spark of unrivaled positivity growing up my natural enthusiasm became obvious to the people around me from volleyball teams to summer camps i have always received similar recognitions most positive sunshine and best friend awards with these affectionate reminders as a constant throughout my childhood i embraced my cheerful personality yet i knew i was much more than this my inability to feel content being known as just the happy kid was my motivation to seek out the things that bring out the in me i threw myself into new ventures from advocating for inclusion at my school and tutoring students in stem subjects to teaching myself piano and taking action in my community against social injustice as i dove into a variety of activities i realized my passion for improving my community and began leveraging my positive outlook as a tool to become a change maker among my peers it is with this action-oriented attitude that i listen for opportunities to improve and enrich the lives around me whether in my local community or elsewhere in the world seeing my phones blasted with headlines boasting environmental and social challenges shatters my heart yet those news stories motivated me to fight for what i believe is right in my sophomore year i learned about the devastating effects of plastic on wildlife leading me to write to texas senator ted cruz urging him to ban the use of plastic bags by local grocery stores just as california did the year before in a physics lab i was told by a male classmate to clean up a mess because it is a job for a woman which was shocking to hear it motivated me to encourage myself and other women to stand up for our rights in the annual women's march for equality for the right cause i am not afraid to spark progressive conversations among my peers from debating potential solutions to immigration policy to working with my principal to plan a school shooting drill [Music] while it is easy to become overwhelmed in the face of societal issues i always see the world not for what it is but for what it could be and i'm willing to help make it happen marching alongside my friends and hundreds of others in the filled me with pride knowing i contributed to a cause that will someday benefit millions of people with hundreds of signs flying overhead i held my freshly painted sign proudly it is within these moments that i champion my positive energy and confidence leading others to stand up during these impactful opportunities for change i now welcome my natural positivity as a gift to drive success in everything i do it is not just a characteristic it is my way of life my defining trait my identity however i learned that it is not just about being positive or receiving smile awards it is what i can achieve and how i can improve the lives of others even so i still appreciated receiving one last best smile award at my 11th grade choir banquet reminding me of the hopeful little kid still shining brightly within me as a kid i always thought i could change the world now i am positive i will so that was my essay all 647 words i know i see like a ton of these videos all the time and i definitely watched so many of them when i was going through the college application process it's honestly just so helpful to hear someone else's take on the common app essay and the fact that there's so many essays out there it just proves that like there's no one way to do it because my essay is definitely very different from a lot of essays that i've seen because most are like more story oriented mine was definitely more me like just talking about like who i am like to the core which was actually so hard to write because i did not like talking about my identity at first but i did feel that it was just like a really important part of me and i really wanted to share that with colleges because they didn't want me for who i am then you know what i don't want them either anyways i think one of the reasons that colleges liked this essay was the fact that it seemed very honest there was a lot of other things that i could have written about given that i'm literally going into tech and business and my essay is about literally nothing even close to that it's literally about like positivity and social justice i think the fact that i took a chance and wrote about something that number one is controversial and number two is just like literally a trait about me that i thought was like worthwhile about telling they must have really seen into my character and hopefully gotten to know me throughout this essay as they were reading it i think another thing is the fact that i put so many little stories in there um even going back to like the very first one when i was in second grade my teacher was talking to me um to like getting like all these like little like smile awards and stuff like when i was a kid and even trying out like all these new things and like not being satisfied with just being seen as that and then going into all this stuff about like social justice i think there were a lot of different facets of the essay that they could get to know like a lot of different sides of me in these just like 650 words so i think that's another huge thing is that i fit a lot of stuff into this essay yet it didn't feel brand at least hopefully it doesn't feel cramped i think that i fit a lot of stuff in there even though it was only about two things which was positivity and social justice but within that you got to know so many things about me that it felt like so much more and then i think the third thing that colleges may have liked about this essay was the fact that it showed that i kind of like cared outside of my little like personal bubble i've been editing like a ton of you guys essays and the one thing that i've noticed is that a lot of the essays are really personal which is like fantastic like you want your essay to be super personal super full of like your own emotions and feelings and details about your life but there always comes a certain turning point in every essay that you want to flip to this is a story about me to this is how i use this story to build myself up and this is how i became the person i am and this is why i am me and how i want to spread the positive things that i will bring to the world and the people around me and that sounds like super cliche but basically to sum up colleges just want to know that you care about the people around you and the world around you and that you are going to use your past experiences to help future causes wow that was really articulate okay cool that's exactly what i want to say so those are the main three reasons that i have of why i think this essay was just really impactful and why maybe colleges liked it and let me into their school definitely make sure to enter the giveaway or if you really need it edited right now then go ahead and just email me at google college essays gmail.com i will definitely be posting a ton more essay videos ranging from like sharing my own essays to like essay tips and i'll be adding to the

letters to writing your first draft to editing your essay and um going on interviews and all the way to making your final college decision so definitely subscribe like this video comment all that stuff enter the giveaway i will see you guys in the next video i hope you enjoyed my essay and kind of the reasoning of why i thought that this might have been a successful essay and i hope you guys have a great day bye thank you for 800. you


hi so today I'm going to be reading my common app essay that got me into UPenn as well as a bunch of other really amazing schools this I think was by far the most difficult part of the entire application for me and I kind of hesitated about hosting this video and reading my essay online just because it is pretty personal and I struggled a lot with this essay and I still wasn't a hundred percent satisfied with the final product but I do remember when I was trying to go through the process of writing my essay it was kind of difficult to find a lot of examples online which is totally understandable because people don't want to share something that's very intimate or personal but I thought I'd share mine I will also be compiling and finding some other sample essays that either I read when I was applying or that I find can I'll put them in the description box so that you can have more samples the version that I'm going to be reading is the one I ended up submitting to most of my schools but it's very different than the version I submitted to all of my early schools I'm probably reading you version 5 million of my common f essay just because I could not stop fixing it and changing it yeah I'm gonna go ahead and leave that 10 a.m. Museum of Modern Art 12:30 p.m. lunch at black tab 2 p.m. wicked on Broadway 6 p.m. Rockefeller Center and Lego store as the informally designated family vacation planner I made sure to accommodate each of my Baily members interests along with my personal desire to constantly make the most of each opportunity which meant that our schedule was always filled to the brim after a long day of dragging my family to the streets of New York City on a hot day in June I was eying the cheesecake in a bakery window when my mom asked me so honey what was your favourite piece at the moment I thought back to the quick two hours we'd spent at the MoMA the place I've been begging to go for years but I realized I couldn't distinctly remember anything about the museum it was a feeling of unfounded emptiness that I'd felt all too many times before the same one that seemed to pervade my entire junior year of high school I become set on continuing every activity I joined over the years while self studying for extra AP exams and taking on extra tutoring jobs on the side time fled and my commitments grew I found myself missing my brother's swim meets and friends birthday parties suggest to keep up as my final summer of high school grew dauntingly closed I found myself sitting in my room one day gazing at the growing collection of words I had accumulated over the years there was one in particular that stood out the trophy for winning second runner-up at the 2018 National American miss pageant I signed up for the competition out of a determination to disprove the stereotype of pageant queens being trademarked for their blonde hair and fair skin but looking back the initial excitement of winning had died down and the only thing I could truly remember was the amazing and diverse girls I'd met it's a friend I made and the stories I shared that made me smile not the crown from that moment on I knew that making my last year of high school truly memorable meant not only pursuing end results but also appreciating the paths to get there and the people that made them possible over the summer I stayed after work to drive coffee with colleagues from my internship and took my family with me on my trip to the national championship of my debate tournament and as the school year approached instead of spending evenings hidden in my room trying to get ahead on an article I've been writing I laughed and chat along with the rest of my family after dinner following a particularly difficult physics exam I head to a local bubble tea shop to play uno with some friends to relax although that could be more intense in the exam itself just these seemingly small changes have made school both less stressful and more rewarding half a year later and headed back to the MoMA as I'm writing this I'm sitting at cafe two sipping a lot today and overlooking the sculpture garden after an entire day a lot of to studying and learning about a couple of exhibitions in the museum I can undoubtedly say that my favourite piece I saw was Frida Kahlo's Phuong Chang and I a reflection of kalos strength through a difficult time Browning herself in her artwork and relationships through my time in college and beyond there's no doubt that I'll keep myself busy going from an economic seminar to volunteering at the library and then from dance practices to working on my own startup but I'll make sure to enjoy each moment rather than trying to fit 30 hours into a day I'll fully appreciate the 24 hours that I have so that was my essay I'm sorry if it was kind of underwhelming it's an essay that went through so many drafts and revisions I honestly can't even tell which version is best anymore but this is the one that I settled on and ended up submitting it included a lot of personal details about myself that I didn't get to show through the rest of my application and I think it still touched on a more broad message that a lot of people can relate to about trying to fit too much stuff into your schedule I hope this video was helpful if you have any questions about essay writing or the application process in general please leave a comment and I'm gonna be making another video after this I'll be sharing the lessons that I learned from going through this process of writing the essay and I'm going to be answering your questions alright thank you so much for watching and I hope you guys are all staying safe and having a great summer bye [Music]
oh this is this has been a lot hey guys welcome back to class with cast a series where I give you advice on how to get into your dream schools my name is Cassandra Chou I'm a student at Yale make sure you check out my last video where I reveal all my high school staff including my GPA my test scores my class ranking etc and now it is the spookiest season of the year because yes it is college application season so what are we going to cover in this video first I'm going to give you a few takeaways from my writing process and coming up with my common app second I'm going to read a never before seen never before published essay that I submitted for many colleges as one of my supplements third I'm going to break down components of that essay using the takeaways that I'll talk about in the beginning and lastly I'm going to give you a list of resources links books that I found really helpful when I was writing the college essay when I got into all eight Ivy League schools and every school that I applied to my common app essay went viral it was absolutely insane the reactions that I received from people and it really did move me to tears people will reach out to me saying that they are less ashamed by their English pronunciations immigrants felt less alone in their struggles and people thought about their families and honor their parents memories or reached out to reconnect with them readers all around the world were inspired to pursue the Arts and sort of see the value of storytelling in times like these so how did this come about so my first takeaway for you is don't get too hung up on the prompt for me would stab my creativity and I wouldn't be able to free write I constantly be checking back to the question and really limiting my imagination for what this essay can be takeaway number two your first ideas are valuable but you need to dig deeper than that so one of my obvious choices for my coming up as would have been my journalism career it is what I have devoted a lot of my high school life a lot of time and energy to but I gave myself the freedom to explore to be creative to push beyond that and not just write about my accomplishments now that's not to say that I didn't talk about my journalism I did I used that essay in other places and other supplements where I cut it and trimmed it for different purposes but for your comment at don't look for the obvious look for the unexpected takeaway number three I would say find someone you trust so my mom was actually the one who convinced me to use this for my common app essay I wasn't planning on it it was just seemed like way too personal for an admissions officer to read but she read it and she recognized that this was the one that really captured Who I am at the heart of it my mom is brutally honest is something's not working she's gonna tell me straight up and I value that sure sometimes the truth hurts but you got to do what you gotta do you gotta kill your darlings move on put that ego away and just get back to the drawing board now you can have other people read it such as your closest mentors teachers and sometimes your closest friends even but I would warn against showing it to too many people because then you'll have so many voices floating around in your head you might not be able to discern which one is yours and follow your instinct because at the end of the day this is your essay takeaway number four drafts lots of them you guys I had to go through so many drafts to get my common app essay to its final stage sure I wrote the very genesis of it maybe at the beginning of summer before senior year but through that summer I generated like 9 or 10 drafts of this same piece takeaway number 5 assessable language now you don't have to be Shakespeare to get into college your writing should be accessible to the general public one piece of feedback that I received from all around the world is that my being like my essay because it was it's easy to read easy to understand there were no super big vocab words all my sentences were pretty clean-cut clear I think writing simply is really the key to it all because it just allows the reader a more direct channel to you from writing from your heart but takeaway number six every word counts just because I wrote doesn't mean that I didn't agonize over every single word because at the end of the day you have a limited amount of words so you want to make every single word count yes when you're in the process of writing your very first draft or your first few drafts don't over edit yourself because I'll stem your creativity but once you get into editing mode you really want to examine the function of every sentence in every paragraph takeaway number seven elements of a good story now what do I mean by this well we all have our favorite stories we all have our favorite books our favorite TV shows our favorite movies and especially in writing you can identify certain elements that you know make a good story that could be very descriptive imagery or an inner monologue that's very captivating or dialogue that just pops for me one of my favorite elements is the full circle so if you notice in the beginning of my essay I talked about the house building a home it's kind of messed up with the words but that at the end I bring you back to a full circle by sort of landing it in an unexpected place I switch the words I create imagery that is unexpected but still rings true to what the essay is because I'm coming full circle I would encourage you to identify what makes a story sing for you and sort of practice and use that in your writing to take away number eight values does this essay reflect who you are when I'm editing I want to make sure every sentence serves a purpose but a purpose of what well your values capture who you are and how you see the world I asked myself what values I wanted this essay to illustrate and looking back I can see values of strength perseverance creativity representation compassion kindness it was also really important to me that this piece tied together Who I am as person as a whole what I mean by that is if you look at my many different extracurriculars I'm very much into journalism and and poetry and playwriting and leadership in school and community service it's all a little bit scattered but what this essay did was explain why I do everything that I do it's because I love storytelling I believe in the power of storytelling to help change communities and shine light on the underrepresented my common app essay captures my mojo and it describes what drives me to do what I do every day and cry honestly still does capture very much to this day three years later why I do what I do hopefully your essay is something that you are proud of because you have figured out a little bit of who you are and you've put that on paper bonus I don't know which takeaway this fits under but I just thought of the incorporation of my mom into my common app essay it's always a little bit difficult to balance an essay when you bring in another character and that character is like an integral part of your essay for example if you're writing an essay about how your grandma really inspired your love for cooking and gardening and shapes the way you see the world in terms of like kindness and compassion like that's that's good you want to focus on how that shaped you because if you focus too much on grandma like the colleges are not accepting grandma they're accepting you so that's something that I had to go back and edit with and try to balance out is how much my mom is a central figure of okay it's time for supplements so I wrote this in the summer before senior year it took me about 3-4 months to go through all of the college supplements so I used some version of this particular supplement with this particular metaphor in my applications for Harvard Columbia Princeton and the UC school system here goes I have not seen this essay for a very long time so let's see and after this I will check out how closely this essay adhered to my list of takeaways in terms of my process and end result well I think about it it was this metaphor is a bit of a stretch but stick with me lights up on a couch potato literally I will explain when I was 9 I wrote my first play about a boy who ate so much junk food and watched so much TV that he turned into a starchy crop stuck to his sofa a troupe of professional travelling actors from the imagination machine preferred that performed my comedic skit in front of giggling elementary school students as the audience laughed at my human turned couch potato I knew I was on the right path to winning a Tony Award after all a potato is like a play it begins underground the roots pushed through darkness reaching for nutrients and a strong grip on the earth I am alone in my room seed of an idea that consumes me words filled the page in a frenzy that would make Samuel fret that that would make Samuel French flinch that is math fool lights up on news articles and personal intimate histories collected from hours of research I dig until I can curl my fingers around what feels like a story conflict check biting dialog check characters I want to simultaneously hug and slap check because my perspective has shifted sprouts spring from the seeds eyes and the plant breaks the surface I format and muster the courage to send my words into the unknown to collaborate with artists and bring it to life my play no longer flourishes through willpower alone it is a team effort to take care of the seedling the countdown to opening night begins you want to hear the back story I came up with for my character it has questions like these from actors that captivate me in rehearsal the universe is no longer only mine directors actors producers stage managers live and breathe in a world that I built cue the Italian runs unscripted curse words and giggles in an empty theater yet theater without an audience is just rehearsal life as a potato isn't easy there are powerful forces of nature to deal with and the struggle to grow to emerge stronger than before every meeting with an artistic team of visionary scrapes and away an unnecessary scene or discovers another layer or goes off on a tangent entirely and those are the best conversations conversations that deeply move me when an actor shares his own experience about losing a parent that reaffirmed me in my moments of soul-crushing depth that validate the reason why I write in hopes that my stories may resonate with even one person in the audience the potato reaches maturation when it loses some of its leaves vines changing color to something more beautiful it is now ready to be presented to the public i Q gasps wet cheeks and laughter from the audience you know in that moment everyone eats potatoes theater equalizes the playing field oh I I really stretch this metaphor where was I everyone eats potatoes fever equalizes the playing field just as the potato spreads across the globe whether my plays are performed in a school's Church turn theatres a white box in New York the Stella Adler theater in Hollywood or the goal Old Globe Theater in San Diego we clap because we believe after house lights go up audience members approached me with their life stories in hand and those are the moments I tear up and marvel at the power of words after experiencing imagination in action I don't think I'll be turning into a couch potato any time soon after all a potato is like a play not a playwright and one potato can yield an entire harvest more okay time to unpack this so the first takeaway which is don't get hung up too much on the prompt yeah at the end of the day does answer the prompt it is like an intellectual experience that's really captivating my passion and time and energy but I didn't set out writing this with the prompt in mind I just wanted to find another way to express a different side of myself the second takeaway that I said was your first ideas are valuable but you got to dig deeper so indeed my first idea was I wanted to write about playwriting I knew that but I did it in a way that was kind of boring I was name-dropping playwrights that I had read and admired and playwright's that have mentored me that I have had the privilege of being workshops with and that just seemed to rub like readers the wrong way my readers I mean my mom she just said that was kind of dry and it didn't really have the heart that my common app as they had so I guess that also of course wanted to take away 3 which is you really need to find someone that you can trust because they will tell you the hard-hitting truth like that so that brings me to take away 4 yes this one through an insane amount of drafts of course take away five accessible language okay let me deconstruct this a little bit because reading it back just now I realized that it's a little bit wordy and if I can go back I would cut it down even more I think I had too many run-on sentences I was also a bit in love with and the sound of my own prose but I will make an argument for this this piece is about theatrics so I did want to sound a little bit dramatic and I wanted to you know keep the audience on their feet so when I move back and forth from like short short sentences to long sentences it really you know keeps them engaged I think they'll shake up the rhythm of the piece so in that sense it's theatrical and does fit in with like the theme of my overall essay okay it's a pretty bold statement to say I knew I was on the right path to winning a Tony Award yeah I know that's like like so presumptuous of me to say that but I wanted to capture their attention and get let them know that they are admitting a potential Tony award-winner future in the future I don't know is in the cards I don't know I am I actually am I going to go down that path I very much would like to but these things are out of my control but I think what matters here is the gumption and the courage it takes to write a statement like that because like that's bold and very theatrical and something like I don't know a theatre kid would say so I think you fit in with the overall like sa character of it and and the personality of this piece in particular so it kind of balances out my common apathy now you think about it because one of the values of my coming-out is I think humility and then this one sort of bringing level it levels the playing field which is me the applicant there are certain phrases that if you are not acquainted with the theatre world will fly over your head like references like you don't know who Samuel French is or you don't know what an Italian run is like those things were just like fly over your head but I was counting on my readers being smart enough to fill in those gaps even if they weren't you know theater majors or whatever never did theatre in their lives they could still understand that that is something specific to my field takeaway number six well I think I would trim it if I go back and like cut it I think I was a lot more rigorous with my comment ah si and that one's like very very clean and very smooth I think I could have done more work with this supplement but in the end I'm so proud of it I think that every word does count towards something takeaway number seven a very very extended metaphor yeah I really took this metaphor and ran with it ranek dry I would say I love a good metaphor I leaned into it because I thought it was hilarious and visually grabbing and unforgettable and I think was right and yeah I also use another full circle shopper surprise take away eight yeah values so I think that's one of the most important parts the values that I see in this essay are creativity passion perseverance growth collaboration at the end of the day I think I'm really proud of it it captures a kernel of who I was in that moment even reading it like three years later so finally we come to the fourth part which is resources so I didn't sign up for any outside help or agencies or had a writing tutor but that is definitely a resource you can use for the past couple of summers I have tutored you know high school students and help them edit their essays and I think it honestly really is helpful for someone kind of like a stranger almost to come in and see things that you can't necessarily see yourself but the alternative which is what I went with our essay writing books so here some that I read and I found incredibly helpful I think one of the best pieces advice that Ethan Sawyer writes is don't boast whine or plead and I think that's like a really good rule for life in general but especially on your college ah Harry Bart's book was actually one of the ones that I really consulted but to go with the grain of salt but it's so so helpful it has some amazing essays in there that are just timeless like they could have been written now and I wouldn't know the difference that's how good they are and it really changes the way you think as a writer because I feel like when we talk about college application essays we are conditioned to think about one type of essay or one particular genre or writing format but really like the possibilities are endless and this book will help you see that so highly recommend she breaks down good essays he breaks down bad essays which is equally as important best of luck on your writing journey don't worry this is not my last video about writing there is so much more to say on this topic I know but I'm out of breath now and I want you to leave your comments your questions in the comments below so I know who what to talk about for my next video I want to know what's helpful for you guys I'm sending you my prayers thoughts light joy remember take care of yourself through this essay writing process and I hope you discover something awesome about yourself Cheers
